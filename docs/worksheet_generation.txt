Currently, there is no single "Worksheet API" from a major LLM provider
(like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google) that accepts a prompt and returns a
finished PDF file with accurate scientific diagrams.

However, you can achieve this by chaining a few APIs together. This is
how educational platforms (like MagicSchool or Diffit) build their
tools. The "Builder" Solution: Chaining APIs

If you are looking to build this capability yourself, you would
typically use an Orchestrator Pattern involving three distinct steps: 1.
Content Generation (The Brain)

Use a standard LLM API (like GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to generate
the text content.

    Prompt: Ask the model to output the worksheet structure (questions,
    titles, vocabulary) in a structured format like JSON or Markdown.

    Why: These models are excellent at pedagogy and formatting text but
    cannot natively "render" a file.

2. Diagram Generation (The Visuals)

Generating accurate science diagrams (like a Periodic Table with labels)
is difficult for image generators (like DALL-E 3) because they often
misspell text or "hallucinate" chemical symbols.

    Better Approach (Diagrams-as-Code): Ask the LLM to write code to
    generate the diagram.

        Example: Ask the LLM to write Python (Matplotlib) code to plot a
        graph or Mermaid.js syntax to draw a flowchart.

        Example: For the Periodic Table, you wouldn't generate an image;
        you would ask the LLM to generate an HTML table styled with CSS
        to look like the periodic table. This ensures the text is
        perfectly readable and searchable.

3. Document Assembly (The renderer)

Use a code-execution tool to stitch it all together into a PDF.

    Method: You can ask the LLM to write a Python script using a library
    like ReportLab or FPDF.

    Workflow:

        The Python script takes the text from Step 1.

        It executes the drawing code from Step 2 (saving the diagram as
        a .png).

        It compiles both into a final PDF.

The "No-Code" Alternatives

If you were asking because you simply want to use such a tool rather
than build one, there are several "wrapper" applications that use the
method above to provide this exact service for teachers:

    Monsha.ai / MagicSchool.ai: These platforms allow you to type
    "Create a worksheet on the Periodic Table" and they will generate
    the text. Some have integrated image search (finding existing
    diagrams from the web) rather than generating new ones, which is
    often more accurate for science.

    Gamma App: While designed for slides, it uses AI to generate text +
    images and allows for exporting to PDF. It handles the layout
    automatically.

Diagram Recommendation for Science

For your specific need (Periodic Table), I strongly recommend not using
a generative image AI (like Midjourney or DALL-E). It will almost
certainly render the atomic masses or element symbols incorrectly.

    Use this trigger instead: When using an LLM, ask it to "Generate an
    SVG code snippet of the Periodic Table highlighting the metalloids."
    SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is code-based, meaning the text will
    be perfect, and the image will be crisp at any size.

a workflow using Monsha, a tool that effectively acts as a user-friendly
"interface" for the API process described above, showing how it handles
mixed text and diagrams for teachers.
