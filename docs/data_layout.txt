I am worried that we are overlooking the complexity of the various data types and how they
relate to one another.

For example, the app currently has this as the left side bar: docs/images/left_side_bar.png where
roster, tests, scantrons, grading, analytics, and standards are all at the same "level"

In actual use however, the data would be much more complex.

For example, the data would likely be more like this:

Course (Earth/Space Science, Physical Science, etc...)
	Unit (The planets, Gravity, Rock Formation, etc...)
		Tests
			Test 1
			Test 2
		Quizzes
			Quiz 1
			Quiz 2
		Presentations
		Activities
	Blocks (Period of the day)
		Block 1
			Roster (students in class)
			Unit (The planets, Gravity, Rock Formation, etc...)
				Tests
					Test 1
						Test 1 Scantrons
						Test 1 Grading
					Test 2
						Test 2 Scantrons
						Test 2 Grading

			
It seems to me that the left-hand bar should likely only contain a list of courses (top-level) and a way to create a new course.

Does this make sense? I want to make sure that the data model and app workflow is well thought out before making too much progress.
