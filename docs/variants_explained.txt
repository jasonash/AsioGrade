⏺ Great question - let me clarify the workflow:

  Variants are completely optional. Here's the intended workflow:

  Standard Workflow (No Variants)

  1. Create an assessment with questions
  2. Optionally generate A/B/C/D versions (randomizes question/answer order for different test copies)
  3. Publish and assign to sections
  4. All students get the same questions (just shuffled if you used versions)

  DOK Variant Workflow (For Differentiated Instruction)

  This is for teachers who want to give different difficulty levels to different students based on their DOK (Depth of Knowledge) level:

  1. Create base assessment with questions
  2. Optionally generate DOK variants for specific student groups:
    - DOK 1 (Recall) - simpler questions or easier distractors
    - DOK 2 (Skill/Concept) - standard difficulty
    - DOK 3 (Strategic) - more complex reasoning
    - DOK 4 (Extended) - highest complexity
  3. Students assigned a DOK level in their roster get the matching variant
  4. Students without a DOK level get the base assessment

  When to Use Variants

  - Skip variants for standard tests where everyone gets the same assessment
  - Use variants when you want to differentiate:
    - Struggling students get DOK 1 (simpler)
    - Advanced students get DOK 3/4 (more challenging)
    - Same learning objectives, adjusted complexity

  Does this clarify things? Would you like me to update any UI text to make this workflow clearer, or is there a different workflow you had in mind?
